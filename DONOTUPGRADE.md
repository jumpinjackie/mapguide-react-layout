# Packages which cannot be upgraded until further notice

## `@types/ol`

Current Version: `6.3.1`
Latest Version: `6.4.1`

Reason for holding back: Latest version does not work with latest version of TypeScript. Fix is actually already in, but we need to wait for a new version of the typings to be published
