  # A pre-existing yarn.lock appears to confuse yarn with regards to @types packages, namely a * version
  # does not go for the latest available version of said package when doing a "yarn install" with the
  # new package version with a pre-existing yarn.lock. This causes a whole load of bogus duplicate identifer
  # errors as dependent @types packages will now pull down a private copy of this * version dependency (that is
  # not the latest one)
  #
  # Nuking the yarn.lock file before installing with the latest version of said package does not have this problem
  # as the generated yarn.lock file will correctly show a * version package as the latest version
  #
  # UPDATE 01 Mar 2017: Unconditionally nuking yarn.lock does not play nice with in-range updates done by greenkeeper
  # so I'll fall back to putting @types/react to the greenkeeper ignore list and manually updating this one package
  # - del yarn.lock
  # install packages, this will also do a production build as a postinstall
  - yarn install
  - yarn audit
