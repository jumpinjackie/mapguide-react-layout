# Importing Modules

Modules in `mapguide-react-layout` can be imported in two ways

For all the modules referenced on the right hand side, prepend `mapguide-react-layout/lib` for the actual module name to import

For example the module ["api/common"](modules/_api_common_.html) should be imported as `mapguide-react-layout/lib/api/common`

For convenience you can also import whatever you require through the "catch-all" `mapguide-react-layout` module.

For example, the ["setCurrentView"](modules/_actions_map_.html#setcurrentview) action can be imported in two ways:

 * `import { setCurrentView } from "mapguide-react-layout/lib/actions/map";`
 * `import { setCurrentView } from "mapguide-react-layout";`
