## External Layer Set

This section represents layers that are managed by the External Layer Manager component. Layers within
this section have mutable draw order and can be re-ordered by the External Layer Manager UI or through
the layer manager API provided by the viewer.

Layers in this section will always display on top of layers in the `Core Map Layer Set`. There is no means for layers in the `Core Map Layer Set` to display on top of this section.

## Core Map Layer Set

This group represents the main focus your viewer application. Layers within this section have fixed draw order and cannot be re-ordered by any UI or viewer APIs.
