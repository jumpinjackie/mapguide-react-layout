     * Task Pane
     * Legend
     * Selection
   * New script commands are registered by default that can push new visibility/focus states to this redux state brach. As a result, any existing InvokeScript widgets that toggled the TaskPane/Legend/SelectionPanel (these commands exist if you created a fresh Application Definition in Maestro), now work out of the box and no longer show `[X] Error` placeholders
   * As a result of the new redux state branch, any InvokeURL command executed now automatically toggles the visibility/focus of the Task Pane to be the active element (if hidden or not visible).
