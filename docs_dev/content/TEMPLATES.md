# Launching a viewer with a template

NOTE: The terms `Flexible Layout` and `Application Definition` are interchangable. Where one is mentioned, it also means the other and vice versa.

Assuming you installed the viewer as `viewer` under your MapGuide wwwroot. You can launch the viewer as follows:

`http://servername/mapguide/viewer/$ENTRY_POINT?resource=$RESOURCEID`

Where:

 * `$ENTRY_POINT` is the name of the entry point HTML file below
 * `$RESOURCEID` is the resource id of the Web Layout or Flexible Layout (eg. `Library://Samples/Sheboygan/Layouts/Sheboygan.WebLayout`)

You can also provide the following optional parameters:

 * `locale` - The language code to use for localized strings (default: `en`)
