// We have to define these types manually, as there is no JSDoc analogue for this plugin to translate from

     * The ol.DeviceOrientation class provides access to information from
     * DeviceOrientation events.  See the [HTML 5 DeviceOrientation Specification](
     * http://www.w3.org/TR/orientation-event/) for more details.
     * 
     * Many new computers, and especially mobile phones
     * and tablets, provide hardware support for device orientation. Web
     * developers targeting mobile devices will be especially interested in this
     * class.
     * 
     * Device orientation data are relative to a common starting point. For mobile
     * devices, the starting point is to lay your phone face up on a table with the
     * top of the phone pointing north. This represents the zero state. All
     * angles are then relative to this state. For computers, it is the same except
     * the screen is open at 90 degrees.
     * 
     * Device orientation is reported as three angles - `alpha`, `beta`, and
     * `gamma` - relative to the starting position along the three planar axes X, Y
     * and Z. The X axis runs from the left edge to the right edge through the
     * middle of the device. Similarly, the Y axis runs from the bottom to the top
     * of the device through the middle. The Z axis runs from the back to the front
     * through the middle. In the starting position, the X axis points to the
     * right, the Y axis points away from you and the Z axis points straight up
     * from the device lying flat.
     * 
     * The three angles representing the device orientation are relative to the
     * three axes. `alpha` indicates how much the device has been rotated around the
     * Z axis, which is commonly interpreted as the compass heading (see note
     * below). `beta` indicates how much the device has been rotated around the X
     * axis, or how much it is tilted from front to back.  `gamma` indicates how
     * much the device has been rotated around the Y axis, or how much it is tilted
     * from left to right.
     * 
     * For most browsers, the `alpha` value returns the compass heading so if the
     * device points north, it will be 0.  With Safari on iOS, the 0 value of
     * `alpha` is calculated from when device orientation was first requested.
     * ol.DeviceOrientation provides the `heading` property which normalizes this
     * behavior across all browsers for you.
     * 
     * It is important to note that the HTML 5 DeviceOrientation specification
     * indicates that `alpha`, `beta` and `gamma` are in degrees while the
     * equivalent properties in ol.DeviceOrientation are in radians for consistency
     * with all other uses of angles throughout OpenLayers.
     * 
     * To get notified of device orientation changes, register a listener for the
     * generic `change` event on your `ol.DeviceOrientation` instance.

     * 
     * This extends {@link ol.Observable} with observable properties, where each
     * property is observable as well as the object as a whole.
     * 
     * Classes that inherit from this have pre-defined properties, to which you can
     * add your owns. The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as
     * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,
     * {@link ol.Map} has a `target` property, accessed with `getTarget()`  and
     * changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however settable. There
     * are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For example,
     * `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.
     * 
     * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by
     * registering a listener. For example, {@link ol.View} has a `center`
     * property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would call the
     * function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within the
     * function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()` would
     * return the new center.
     * 
     * You can add your own observable properties with
     * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.
     * You can listen for changes on that property value with
     * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all
     * properties with {@link ol.Object#getProperties object.getProperties()}.
     * 
     * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.
     * You can, for example, give your map object a title with
     * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The
     * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in
     * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.
     * 
     * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method. E.g.
     * object.unset('foo').

     * An ol.View object represents a simple 2D view of the map.
     * 
     * This is the object to act upon to change the center, resolution,
     * and rotation of the map.
     * 
     * ### The view states
     * 
     * An `ol.View` is determined by three states: `center`, `resolution`,
     * and `rotation`. Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.
     * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.
     * 
     * An `ol.View` has a `projection`. The projection determines the
     * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the
     * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is
     * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).
     * 
     * ### The constraints
     * 
     * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the
     * states of the view. Any value can be passed to the setters. And the value
     * that is passed to a setter will effectively be the value set in the view,
     * and returned by the corresponding getter.
     * 
     * But an `ol.View` object also has a *resolution constraint*, a
     * *rotation constraint* and a *center constraint*.
     * 
     * As said above, no constraints are applied when the setters are used to set
     * new states for the view. Applying constraints is done explicitly through
     * the use of the `constrain*` functions (`constrainResolution` and
     * `constrainRotation` and `constrainCenter`).
     * 
     * The main users of the constraints are the interactions and the
     * controls. For example, double-clicking on the map changes the view to
     * the "next" resolution. And releasing the fingers after pinch-zooming
     * snaps to the closest resolution (with an animation).
     * 
     * The *resolution constraint* snaps to specific resolutions. It is
     * determined by the following options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`,
     * `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`. If `resolutions` is set, the other three
     * options are ignored. See documentation for each option for more
     * information.
     * 
     * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined
     * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.
     * By default the rotation value is snapped to zero when approaching the
     * horizontal.
     * 
     * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By
     * default the center is not constrained at all.

         * 
         *     view.animate({zoom: view.getZoom() + 1});
         * 
         * By default, the animation lasts one second and uses in-and-out easing.  You
         * can customize this behavior by including `duration` (in milliseconds) and
         * `easing` options (see {@link ol.easing}).
         * 
         * To chain together multiple animations, call the method with multiple
         * animation objects.  For example, to first zoom and then pan:
         * 
         *     view.animate({zoom: 10}, {center: [0, 0]});
